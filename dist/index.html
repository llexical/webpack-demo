      <p>Webpack is based upon the idea that you pass in multiple files and it outputs just one file.</p>
      <p>This is great for javascript as it means that Webpack will read all your files, and merge them
      together to make one file which can be read by any browser.</p>
      <p>Webpack by default uses something called babel to transpile javascript from modern versions (such as ES6) to old versions depending on how far back you want to go.</p>
      <p>To see this working in a really quick demo go to the console and view the log message, you can then change the message in the src files and see a different log message when you refresh.</p>
